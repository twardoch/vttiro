Hi guys, Dave Lawrence from the California Type
Foundry here. I am going to be showing you in

00:00:08.897 --> 00:00:09.397
FontLab

00:00:12.494 --> 00:00:14.435
7 how I make some of my typefaces. I started using
FontLab 6. It

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.200
Was the 2018. And then I started, when FontLab 7
came out, I switched over to

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:27.106
That in 2019. I like FontLab because it has some
really powerful drawing tools, there's many ways

00:00:27.206 --> 00:00:27.706
you can

00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:30.576
Draw. The way that you can switch between masters
allows you to do a lot of different,

00:00:41.467 --> 00:00:32.924
You can basically it customizes to your workflow.
And beyond that, the panels feature

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:39.192
In InDesign. I mean, it has the features like the
Adobe products, so since I'm used to that from

00:00:55.763 --> 00:00:50.544
InDesign and some of those other things, it has
that. So, it has a lot of powerful features that

00:00:50.644 --> 00:00:51.144
can help you get everything

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.600
Done down to the smallest detail. Okay, so I'll
see you onto the videos.
