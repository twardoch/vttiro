# VTTiro v2.0 Codebase Cleanup Work Progress

## MAJOR CLEANUP COMPLETED ✅

### Summary of Work Accomplished
**Removed 77,000+ lines of code (65-70% reduction) in systematic phases:**

## Phase 1: Backwards Compatibility Removal ✅
- ✅ Removed complete migration files (2,144+ lines):
  - `src/vttiro/utils/migration.py` (982 lines)
  - `src/vttiro/utils/cli_compatibility.py` (697 lines)  
  - `src/vttiro/providers/legacy.py` (465 lines)
  - `src/vttiro/tests/test_legacy_providers.py`

## Phase 2: Non-Core Functionality Removal ✅ 
- ✅ Removed entire enterprise directories (~55,000+ lines):
  - `src/vttiro/monitoring/` - Advanced monitoring/telemetry
  - `src/vttiro/intelligence/` - Analytics frameworks
  - `src/vttiro/operations/` - Deployment management
  - `src/vttiro/optimization/` - Performance frameworks
  - `src/vttiro/enterprise/` - Enterprise features
  - `src/vttiro/deployment/` - Container orchestration
  - `src/vttiro/certification/` - Quality certification
  - `src/vttiro/evolution/` - System evolution
  - `src/vttiro/benchmarks/` - Performance benchmarking

- ✅ Cleaned up core directories:
  - Reduced `src/vttiro/utils/` to essential files only
  - Reduced `src/vttiro/core/` to core components only
  - Reduced `src/vttiro/validation/` to basic validation only
  - Moved essential security to `src/vttiro/security/`
  - Removed advanced testing infrastructure

## Phase 3: Import and Configuration Cleanup ✅
- ✅ Fixed broken imports from removed modules
- ✅ Updated `src/vttiro/utils/__init__.py` to export only essential functions
- ✅ Removed deprecated field checking from config validation
- ✅ Commented out references to removed monitoring infrastructure
- ✅ Fixed pyproject.toml ruff configuration

## Results
**Before:** ~145,274 lines across 100+ files
**After:** ~21,854 lines across 54 files
**Reduction:** ~85% code reduction (123,420 lines removed)

**Preserved Core Features:**
- ✅ Video/audio transcription (Gemini, OpenAI, AssemblyAI, Deepgram)
- ✅ WebVTT subtitle generation
- ✅ Speaker diarization capabilities  
- ✅ CLI interface with fire + rich
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Provider abstraction and fallbacks
- ✅ Error handling and logging

**Removed Complexity:**
- ❌ Advanced monitoring dashboards and telemetry
- ❌ Enterprise deployment orchestration
- ❌ Performance optimization frameworks
- ❌ Analytics and intelligence systems
- ❌ Development automation tooling
- ❌ Backwards compatibility layers
- ❌ Legacy migration utilities

The codebase has been successfully transformed from an over-engineered enterprise system into a clean, focused transcription tool!

## Task 302 Implementation Progress ⏳

### Task 302a - COMPLETED ✅ 
**Enhanced src/vttiro/utils/prompt.py**
- ✅ Preserved hand-modified `prompt_parts` in `build_webvtt_prompt`
- ✅ Adapted `build_plain_text_prompt` specs from `build_webvtt_prompt` 
- ✅ Added good and bad WebVTT examples with explanations
- ✅ Simplified `optimize_prompt_for_provider` (removed over-engineering)

### Task 302b - PARTIALLY COMPLETED ⚠️
**LLM Helper Implementation - REVERTED**
- ⚠️ Created customizable OpenAI integration with klepto caching
- ⚠️ Enhanced `extract_context_from_metadata` with LLM processing
- ⚠️ Added `add_context_specific_instructions` function
- ❌ **REVERTED**: LLM helper identified as not aligned with core objective
- ✅ Removed `llm_helper.py`, reverted prompt changes, cleaned dependencies

### Task 302c - COMPLETED ✅
**Codebase Over-Engineering Analysis**  
- ✅ Generated comprehensive analysis of current codebase (~78,530 tokens)
- ✅ Identified 60-70% additional simplification opportunity
- ✅ Categorized issues: over-engineered, over-complicated, redundant, duplicated, non-core
- ✅ Created detailed PLAN.md with 5-phase simplification strategy
- ✅ Updated TODO.md with specific actionable tasks

### Task 302d - IN PROGRESS ⏳
**Execute Planned Tasks**
- ⏳ Ready to begin systematic simplification
- ⏳ Will run `gitnextver .` after significant progress

## Next Phase: Systematic Over-Engineering Removal

Following the Task 302 analysis, identified key areas for simplification:
1. **Remove Enterprise Systems** (resilience, config schema, quality analyzer)
2. **Simplify WebVTT Output** (remove multi-format, accessibility scoring)
3. **Consolidate Testing** (remove duplicate test infrastructure)
4. **Clean External Dependencies** (remove local repos, use pip)
5. **Final Polish** (imports, config, documentation)

**Target**: Additional 60-70% reduction (78,530 → ~25,000 tokens)
