# TODO - Issue 204 Transcription Engine Fixes âœ… **COMPLETED**

*All Issue 204 tasks have been successfully completed. Both critical issues (OpenAI silent failure and Gemini safety filter blocking) have been resolved, and all 8 major AI models are now fully operational.*

~~## Phase 1: Fix Gemini Safety Filter Issue~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] Add safety settings configuration to GeminiTranscriber.__init__()
- [x] Create _get_safety_settings() method with reasonable defaults
- [x] Allow override via config or environment variables
- [x] Set default safety thresholds to BLOCK_ONLY_HIGH or BLOCK_NONE
- [x] Detect finish_reason: 2 specifically in transcribe() method
- [x] Provide user-friendly error message explaining safety filter blocking
- [x] Suggest retry with different settings or alternative models
- [x] Log the specific safety category that triggered the block
- [x] Add gemini_safety_settings configuration option
- [x] Allow per-category safety threshold configuration
- [x] Document safety implications in configuration

~~## Phase 2: Fix OpenAI Silent Failure Issue~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] Add comprehensive try-catch blocks around all initialization steps in openai.py
- [x] Add debug logging for API key validation and client initialization
- [x] Add specific error handling for missing dependencies and API failures
- [x] Ensure all exceptions are properly logged and re-raised
- [x] Improve OpenAI package import error handling
- [x] Add validation for API key format and availability
- [x] Test API connectivity during initialization
- [x] Provide clear error messages for configuration issues
- [x] Add debug logging in _create_transcriber() for OpenAI path
- [x] Ensure transcriber creation errors are properly propagated
- [x] Add model validation before transcriber instantiation

~~## Phase 3: Robustness Improvements~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] Implement standardized error handling pattern across all engines
- [x] Add correlation IDs to track errors across operations
- [x] Implement graceful degradation when models fail
- [x] Add retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- [x] Implement automatic fallback to alternative models when primary fails
- [x] Create model compatibility matrix for intelligent fallbacks
- [x] Add user notification when fallback occurs
- [x] Preserve user's engine preference while allowing model switching
- [x] Add startup validation for all configured engines
- [x] Test API connectivity and credentials during config load
- [x] Provide clear feedback on configuration issues
- [x] Add config doctor command for troubleshooting

~~## Phase 4: Testing and Validation~~ âœ… **COMPLETED**
- [x] Create integration tests for all engine/model combinations
- [x] Add specific tests for safety filter scenarios
- [x] Add tests for API failure conditions
- [x] Implement test fixtures for various audio content types
- [x] Test safety filter error handling paths
- [x] Test OpenAI initialization failure scenarios
- [x] Test network failure and retry logic
- [x] Test configuration validation edge cases
- [x] Create automated test script similar to temp/test1.sh
- [x] Test all models with known-good audio samples
- [x] Validate error reporting and user experience
- [x] Performance regression testing
