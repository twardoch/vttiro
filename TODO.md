- [x] Clean up optional dependencies for removed features in `pyproject.toml`
- [x] Remove unused ML/plotting dependencies (scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
- [x] Keep essential dependencies for audio processing (numpy, scipy for local mode)
- [ ] Update version to 2.0.0 in `pyproject.toml` (requires git tag - user decision)

### 6.3 Code Reliability & Error Handling âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Test import statements and fix any remaining broken imports
- [x] Fix `utils/__init__.py` to import actual functions from modules
